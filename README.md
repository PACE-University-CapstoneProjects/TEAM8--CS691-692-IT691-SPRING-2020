Adopting Blockchain In The Digital Music Industry

Team Members: Pablo Blanco, Andi Maroge.

Customer: Joe Porter, Avery Leider.

Blockchain has become the platform of choice to
revolutionize the collection of artist royalties. In this paper, we
focus on the utilization of blockchain in the Digital Music industry
along with a new method to collect artist royalties. We will
analyze and give various perspectives on how blockchain will
benefit the music industry as whole, at the same time state
the positive aspects and their limitations. We will address the
current status of the platform and merge how the the innovative
additions created by the high-demand streaming platforms (e.g.,
spotify, pandora, etc.). The aforementioned platforms attempt
to re-connect the personal relationship between the artist and
consumer, providing an increase in streams. The application of
blockchain could reform the industry and ensure that the rightful
owners get paid for their music when it plays while eliminating
completely the intermediaries.
